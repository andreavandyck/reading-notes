## A little about me
   I am a (now retired!) recruiter, part time but soon-to-be full time content creator and coach, and digital product entrepreneur.

I love connecting with people, creating beautiful things, and making a lasting difference in people's lives.

### Where I'm From

I'm a Londoner through and through, but I lived in Toronto for just under two years, and since the start of COVID I've been based in Cambridge, UK (where I was born, and in the same house again too!)

I just got engaged to the love of my life! Here's a photo from our 70's theme engagement party
